#Program to find prime numbers in a given range is discussed here. A number is said to be prime if it is divisible by 1 and the number itself. Program to find prime numbers in a given range using loop

CODE:
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
for i in range(a,b+1):
    if i>1:
        for j in range(2,i):
            if(i%j==0):
                break
        else:
            print(i)
