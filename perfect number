#Program to check whether a given number is a perfect number or not is discussed here. A perfect number is a number which is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.

CODE:
a=int(input())
sum=0
for i in range (1,a):
    if(a%i==0):
        sum=sum+i
if(sum==a):
    print('perfect number')
else:
    print('not a perfect number')
