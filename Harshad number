#Program to check whether a number is a Harshad number or not (Niven number) is discussed here. Harshad Number is an integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits.

CODE:
n=int(input())
sum=0
while n>0:
    b=n%10
    sum=sum+b
    n=n//10
if(n%sum!=0):
    print('harshad number')
else:
    print('not harshad number')
